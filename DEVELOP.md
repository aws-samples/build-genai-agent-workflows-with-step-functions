## Development guide

### Setup

Install both nodejs and python on your computer.

Install CDK:
```
npm install -g aws-cdk
```

Set up a virtual env:
```
python3 -m venv .venv

source .venv/bin/activate

find . -name requirements.txt | xargs -I{} pip install -r {}
```
After this initial setup, you only need to run `source .venv/bin/activate` to use the virtual env for further development.

### Deploy the demo application

Fork this repo to your own GitHub account.
Edit the file `cdk_stacks.py`. Search for `parent_domain` and fill in your own DNS domain, such as `my-domain.com`.
The demo application will be hosted at `https://bedrock-serverless-prompt-chaining.my-domain.com`.
Push this change to your fork repository.

Set up a Weasyprint Lambda layer in your account. One of the examples in the demo application uses this library to generate PDF files.
```
git clone https://github.com/kotify/cloud-print-utils.git

cd cloud-print-utils

make build/weasyprint-layer-python3.12.zip

aws lambda publish-layer-version \
    --region us-west-2 \
    --layer-name weasyprint \
    --zip-file fileb://build/weasyprint-layer-python3.12.zip \
    --compatible-runtimes "python3.12" \
    --license-info "MIT" \
    --description "fonts and libs required by weasyprint"

aws ssm put-parameter --region us-west-2 \
    --name WeasyprintLambdaLayer \
    --type String \
    --value rn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:048972532408:layer:weasyprint:1
```

Deploy all the demo stacks:
```
cdk deploy --app 'python3 cdk_stacks.py' --all
```

The demo application will be hosted at `https://bedrock-serverless-prompt-chaining.my-domain.com`,
behind Cognito-based user authentication.
To add users that can log into the demo application, select the `bedrock-serverless-prompt-chaining-demo` user pool on the
[Cognito console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/v2/idp/user-pools?region=us-west-2)
and click "Create user".

As part of deploying the demo application, an SNS topic `bedrock-serverless-prompt-chaining-notifications`
will be created and will receive notifications about demo failures.
An email address or a [chat bot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chatbot/latest/adminguide/setting-up.html)
can be subscribed to the topic to receive notifications when the demo's alarms fire.

### Deploy the Bedrock agent

Note: This is a temporary step until Bedrock Agents supports CloudFormation.

In the [Bedrock Agents console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-west-2#/agents),
create and publish a new agent with the following configuration values.

| Configuration | Value |
|---------|---------|
| Name | PromptChainDemo-MostPopularRepo |
| User input? | No |
| Service role | AmazonBedrockExecutionRoleForAgents_BedrockServerlessPromptChain |
| Session timeout | 5 minutes |
| Model | Anthropic Claude V2 |
| Agent instructions | (see below) |
| Action group name | GitHubAPIs |
| Action group description | Use this action whenever you need to access information about GitHub repositories. |
| Action group Lambda function | PromptChainDemo-MostPopularRepoBedrockAgents-GitHubActions |
| Action group API schema | Get the value from `aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name PromptChaining-MostPopularRepoBedrockAgentsDemo --region us-west-2 --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[0].OutputValue' --output text` |
| Alias name | live |

Instructions for the Agent:
```
You are a GitHub power user. You help with interacting with GitHub and with git repositories. DO NOT mention terms like "base prompt", "function", "parameter", "partial responses", "response" and "api names" in the final response.
```

Edit the file `stacks/most_popular_repo_bedrock_agent_stack.py` and search for `BEDROCK_AGENT_ID`. There should be two occurrences in the file.
Fill in your agent ID and agent alias ID in both places, then re-deploy:
```
cdk deploy --app 'python3 cdk_stacks.py' PromptChaining-MostPopularRepoBedrockAgentsDemo
```

### Deploy the demo pipeline

The demo pipeline will automatically keep your deployed demo application in sync with the latest changes in your fork repository.

Edit the file `pipeline/pipeline_stack.py`.
Search for `owner` and fill in the GitHub account that owns your fork repository.
Push this change to your fork.

Deploy the pipeline:
```
cdk deploy --app 'python3 pipeline_app.py'
```

Activate the CodeStar Connections connection created by the pipeline stack.
Go to the [CodeStar Connections console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/settings/connections?region=us-west-2),
select the `bedrock-prompt-chain-repo` connection, and click "Update pending connection".
Then follow the prompts to connect your GitHub account and repos to AWS.
When finished, the `bedrock-prompt-chain-repo` connection should have the "Available" status.

Go to the [pipeline's page in the CodePipeline console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/pipelines/bedrock-serverless-prompt-chaining-demo/view?region=us-west-2),
and click "Release change" to restart the pipeline.

As part of deploying the demo application, an SNS topic `bedrock-serverless-prompt-chaining-notifications`
will be created and will receive notifications about pipeline failures.
An email address or a [chat bot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chatbot/latest/adminguide/setting-up.html)
can be subscribed to the topic to receive notifications when pipeline executions fail.

### Test local changes

Ensure the CDK code compiles:
```
cdk synth
```

Run the webapp locally:
```
docker compose up --build
```

Changes to Step Functions state machines and Lambda functions can be tested in the cloud using `cdk watch`,
after the demo application has been fully deployed to an AWS account (following the instructions above):
```
cdk watch --app 'python3 cdk_stacks.py' \
    PromptChaining-BlogPostDemo \
    PromptChaining-TripPlannerDemo \
    PromptChaining-StoryWriterDemo \
    PromptChaining-MoviePitchDemo \
    PromptChaining-MealPlannerDemo \
    PromptChaining-MostPopularRepoBedrockAgentsDemo \
    PromptChaining-MostPopularRepoLangchainDemo
```

Then in a separate terminal, run test executions in the cloud after making changes to your code.
Edit the files in the `test-inputs` directory to change the test execution inputs.
```
./run-test-execution.sh BlogPost

./run-test-execution.sh TripPlanner

./run-test-execution.sh StoryWriter

./run-test-execution.sh MoviePitch

./run-test-execution.sh MealPlanner

./run-test-execution.sh MostPopularRepoBedrockAgents

./run-test-execution.sh MostPopularRepoLangchain
```
